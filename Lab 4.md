## 2. Start Django and running servers 
At this session, I will use the default database (i.e., SQLite); start Django project "stevens," run server, and view app; start Django REST project "mycpu," run server, and view app. 
By default, Django uses SQLite. 

### stevens 
To start the project "stevens", I used to the following commands:

- `django-admin startproject stevens`
- `cd stevens`
- `ls`
