**Hello Everyone** 
*This is my repository for Engineering Design VI*
>I'm glad to be in this course with everyone and hope we can all have a great semester
>Now I will give a brief introduction about myself

`I enjoy a lot of stuff`
1. I love exploring good food
- KBBQ (It's amazing)
- Chinese hot pot (my favorite)
- Boba
2. I don't play video games, so I do spend a lot of time outside with my friends
3. I love going to the gym, playing and watching sports (Orlando magic fan here)
