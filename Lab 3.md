# Lab 3: Python
## Instruction
For this lab, the main purpose is to use the information provided in [lesson 3](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson3) to print certain outputs. Before achieving this goal, we need to download python packages first. 
- `dcal`
- `astral`
- `geopy`
---

To complete the download, I used the commands `pip3 install jdcal`, `pip3 install astral` and `pip3 install geopy`.
I created my own enviroment to prevent errors from happening (specifically when terminal shows externally managed error).

## Executing commands 
### 1. cd ~/iot
This command change direction of the terminal to iot, which is the overall document.

### 2. cd *3
This command guide us to lesson 3 directly, instead of using all the extra steps.

### 4. python3 date_example.py
This command gives us the current date in two different types of ways. Meanwhile, information like day of the week, month, year, days after the first day of classes and days before the last day of classes. This can be used as a powerful tool for time tracking.

---
### 5. python3 datetime_example.py
This command prints different examples to show date time

---
### 6. python3 time_example.py
This command prints the time every 10 seconds. We are able to use command `Control C` to interupt (stop the command from running)
