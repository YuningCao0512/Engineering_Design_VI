# Lab 5: Paho-MQTT

In this lab, I will downlaod Paho-MQTT with instruction from [here](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson5). After, i will change directory to the iot repository and update the repository with git pull. Then, I will change directory to Lesson 5 and run [python3 subcpu.py](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/blob/master/lesson5/subcpu.py) on one Terminal and [python3 pubcpu.py](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/blob/master/lesson5/pubcpu.py) on another.

## iot repository 
This is the first task for this lab. This step is to make sure the lab has a foundation to build upon. I used the following command to make sure this step is completed:
- `cd ~/iot`
- `git pull`

These two steps made sure I am able to change directory to the iot repository and update the repository with git pull.
