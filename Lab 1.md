# Lab 1: GHDL and GTKWave
For this lab, I will stall and use GHDL and GTKWave to run an example of a half adder and 4-to-1 multiplexer. However, due to software issues, I was not able to use GTKwave, so I will use Fliplot instead. 

Download guide: [Fliplot](https://github.com/raczben/fliplot) and [GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl/releases)

This is my final product after running the half-adder
