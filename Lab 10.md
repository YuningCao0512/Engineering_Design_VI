# Lab 10: Blockchain
The purpose of this lab is to use terminal to achieve following purposes: 
- Run `hash_value.py` twice and compare results
- Run `snakecoin.py`
- Run `snakecoin-server-full-code.py` on Terminal 1 and mine a new block on Terminal 2
- Clone Python blockchain app and uncomment the last line of `node_server.py`
- Run `node_server.py` on Terminal 1 and `run_app.py` on Terminal 2

The information and instructions come from [this repository](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson10).

## hash_value.py
The main purpose of this part of the lab is to run `hash_value.py` twice and compare results. I will use the following commands to achieve this task.
- `cd ~/iot/lesson10`
- `cat hash_value.py`
- `python3 hash_value.py` (This is the library running the first time)
- `python3 hash_value.py` (This is the library running the second time)

Based on the information provided, here is the corresponding output:
